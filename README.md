# Implementation-of-Genetic-Algorithm---BP-Project
"""
Implement the genetic algorithm using the Python programming language.
The problem should be represented in a way that can be displayed by a 24-bit chromosome for each member of the initial population.
The initial population members are randomly generated. The fitness function criteria is the most similarity to the chromosome 100110101110111110111010.
The new generation is created from a combination of parental genes using one of the recombination methods of mutation or inversion.
